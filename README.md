### Genomic, Network and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Oomycete Effector Arsenal

#### Jamie McGowan and David Fitzpatrick

This site contains supplementary material for "Genomic, Network and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Oomycete Effector Arsenal" including protein sequences and scripts used in our analysis. It also includes source code for the associated website for viewing the [interative sequence similarity networks](https://oomycetes.github.io/).

Protein sequences and the pipeline to identify potential RxLRs are found in the `SupplementaryMaterial` directory.

Interactive versions of the network are available [here](https://oomycetes.github.io/).
